If you are creating a website, [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/?ref=codecode.io) 🏎️ is of utmost importance. Webp is a highly optimized image format. It is supported by all modern browsers which can be confirmed on [caniuse/webp](https://caniuse.com/webp?ref=codecode.io). So don't fret, just convert your images to webp.

### cwebp

To convert any image to webp you can use cwebp. This program is available on all Linux based operating systems. This is the command to use cwebp:

```
cwebp -q 80 image.jpg -o image.webp
```

### webp alias

However, this is far to cumbersome! 😩 Who wants to type the file name twice! 😵 Add this alias to your terminal so you only have to type `webp image.jpg`

```
webp() {
    local filename="${1%.*}"
    local quality=${2:-80}
    cwebp -quiet -q $quality "$1" -o "${filename}-q${quality}.webp"
}
```

This will create a webp image, set the quality to 80, use the same name for the file, and set the extension to webp. Done!

The header image for this article was 12kb as a jpg and 2kb in webp. It is an impressive optimization and the quality is almost identical to the original.

Happy optimizing. 😎
