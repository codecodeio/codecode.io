Typing git over and over gets tedious very fast. 😩 You can save 100,000 keystrokes per year by adding these aliases to Terminal 📟. Now you can type *status* instead of *git status*, *fetch* instead of *git fetch*, *checkout* instead of *git checkout*, and so on. This list does not include all git commands, just the ones I use most often. Add any others you frequently use to save even more keystrokes.

How did I come up with 100,000? That's 100 git commands per day, 5 days a week, times 50 weeks a year, times 4 characters (g-i-t- ), 100\*5\*50\*4=100,000. 👨‍🏫

Some commands can't be added such as *git log* and *git diff* because these programs already exist. There's not much more to it. Enjoy all the time you saved... on a beach 🏖️ with a cocktail 🍹.

```
#Git
alias checkout='git checkout'
alias status='git status'
alias add='git add'
alias commit='git commit'
alias fetch='git fetch'
alias push='git push'
alias pull='git pull'
alias merge='git merge'
alias stash='git stash'
alias branch='git branch'
alias config='git config'
alias tag='git tag'
```
