&#x20;If you have ever tried to use a man page you know how complicated and overwhelming they can be. For example the man page for git, `man git`,  is 1,647 lines of plain text. 😵‍💫 The [tldr pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) CLI is a community effort to simplify [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) with practical examples.

## man page example

```bash
$ man git

NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--no-lazy-fetch]
           [--no-optional-locks] [--no-advice] [--bare] [--git-dir=<path>]
           [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.
...
```

## TLDR

There is a better way; type, `tldr git`, and you will see 37 lines of useful color coded examples. 😌

```bash
$ tldr git

Distributed version control system.
Some subcommands such as commit, add, branch, switch, push, etc. have their own usage documentation.
More information: https://git-scm.com/docs/git.

Create an empty Git repository:

  git init

Clone a remote Git repository from the internet:

  git clone https://example.com/repo.git
...
```

## Installation

The [github page](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) and [tldr.sh website](https://tldr.sh/) list several ways to install tldr but the easiest way on a Mac is to use brew.&#x20;

```bash
brew install tlrc
```

"tlrc" is not a typo. The "tldr" project on brew was abandoned and replaced by "tlrc".&#x20;
